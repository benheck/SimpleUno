# SimpleUno
An extremely bare-bones ATMEGA328P PDIP-28 Arduino Uno compatible dev board.

INSTRUCTIONS:

Use existing socketed Arduino Uno dev board to flash bootloader/fuses onto a PDIP-28 ATMEG328P

Place programmed IC into this dev board either directly soldered or with a socket.

Attach 6 pin FTDI cable, breakout board or such compatible device.

In Arduino IDE select the FTDI's port and set the board as Arduino Uno.

Program away!
